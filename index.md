### About
I am a Data Scientist at McKinsey & Company. 
I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2017 with a degree in Computational and Applied Mathematics, with internships in data science at Nielsen and Uptake.

I'm working with [Panos Toulis](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/Panagiotis.toulis/) on statistically motivated topics in stochastic gradient descent (SGD). 
I will be applying to Statistics - Machine Learning PhD programs this fall of 2018. 



### Research
* [Convergence diagnostics for stochastic gradient descent with constant step size](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06382), with Panos Toulis, AISTATS 2018, oral presentation \\
We focus on detecting the convergence of SGD with constant learning rate to its convergence phase.
Borrowing from the theory of stopping times in stochastic approximation, we developed a simple diagnostic that uses inner products of successive gradients to detect convergence. 
Theoretical and empirical results suggest that the diagnostic reliably detects the phase transition, which can speed up classical procedures.
