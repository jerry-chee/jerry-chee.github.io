#### About
Starting March 2019, I will work as a Research Intern at the Baidu Cognitive Computing Lab in Bellevue, WA. 
Additionally, I've been working with [Panos Toulis](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/Panagiotis.toulis/) on statistically motivated topics in stochastic gradient descent (SGD). 

I worked for 1.5 years as a data scientist at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.
I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2017 with a degree in Computational and Applied Mathematics, with internships in data science at Nielsen and Uptake.

In the Fall of 2019 I will begin a Ph.D. in statistical machine learning (soon to be determined where!).

#### Working Papers
* Exact inference with stochastic gradient methods, with Panos Toulis

#### Publications
* [Convergence diagnostics for stochastic gradient descent with constant step size](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06382), with Panos Toulis, AISTATS 2018, **<span style="color: black">oral presentation</span>**. \\
We focus on detecting the convergence of SGD with constant learning rate to its convergence phase.
Borrowing from the theory of stopping times in stochastic approximation, we developed a simple diagnostic that uses inner products of successive gradients to detect convergence. 
Theoretical and empirical results suggest that the diagnostic reliably detects the phase transition, which can speed up classical procedures.
